                <p>The strategic importance and project budget for your web efforts will largely determine the size and
                    skill depth of your web site development team. Even for a smaller project, however, you’ll need to
                    cover the core team disciplines. In most small to medium projects one person may handle multiple
                    tasks or someone with specialized expertise (graphic design, for instance) is hired for specific
                    assignments.</p>

        <div class="client-says">

            <p>From the beginning I was passionate about learning MERN stack. I saw lot of course in YouTube and udemy.
                But after few days I got lost. Because of proper guideline. Programming Hero is the platform which helps
                me to guide properly, which I couldn't get any other courses out there.</p>
